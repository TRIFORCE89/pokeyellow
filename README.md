# Special Edition by TRIFORCE89, features:

Overall intention was to create a "definitive" Generation 1 game, playing up the nostalgia of our youth. The end result is a game that more closely reflects the anime series. At the same time, the game balance has been tweaked - simultaneously being more difficult in terms of some of the battles, but also providing you the opportunity to have a varied party early on. Graphics have been improved. Cut features restored. Text revised. Hopefully creating something that plays like we remember it, but not how it was. 

- Restore the intro battle cutscene (as was seen in the anime)
- Unique colour palettes for Trainers
- Unique overworked sprites for: Brock, Misty, Lt. Surge, Koga, Sabrina, Blaine, and Bill
- Wild Pokémon locations (borrowed from: https://github.com/Fotomac/nostalgia-yellow)
- Given that, there are now more active catch locations (Rocket Hideout, more bodies of water)
- Bill's Pokémon costume/form is a Clefairy, as in the GBA remake
- Use the Brunette Girl sprite instead of Lass on the overworked when the trainer is not Lass
- Similarly fix instances where a Rocker wasn't using a Rocker overworld sprite
- Better Pokémon colour palettes (i.e., Rattata is now purple)
- Revised Game Corner prizing (with dynamic determination of offering up one of the Hitmons)
- Gym Battles now have revised parties, larger and higher levelled, with a few special moves - all to reflect the anime more closely
- Jessie & James battles are higher-levelled, with some variations in the party for later battles
- Cool Trainers have some expanded parties from the GBA remakes
- Textual revisions throughout, reflecting the anime and GBA remakes - for clarity and character (anime references are now explicit)
- Battles where levels were reduced compared to Red & Blue are now restored
- Similar to the Hitmons, the fossils also have dynamic availability in the Seafoam Islands
- Option to play as a girl (graphics from https://liliebiehlina3siste.deviantart.com/art/PokemonSpecial-Sprites-Blue-166666033)
- Restore cut lines when you lose to Gary in later battles
- Add caught Pokéball icon in Wild battles
- Restore cut gym leader name display on badge screen
- Unique sprite when surfing on Lapras
- Memory optimization of mart inventories and trainer pics
- Improved sprite art for: ghost, gym leaders, champion Gary, Jessie & James (hi Meowth!), Ash, channellers, engineers (closer to Stadium), Giovanni (hi Persian!), Lorelei (more like anime), psychic, rocker (can tell what it is)
- Improved sprite art for the majority of Pokémon (either minor touch-ups or out-right replaced). Combination of Yellow, Gold '97, Pink (https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-148.html), https://piacarrot.deviantart.com/art/151-151-Yellow2GSC-718566907, https://hax.iimarckus.org/post/42817/
- Pikachu Beach minigame is unlocked (you do not need a Surfing Pikachu)

I pulled and modified graphics from a number of sources, the ones linked above are the ones I remember. For the rest, I offer a general shout out to the Skeetendo community. If I've used your work, please let me know, and I'll credit you.
